Validated existing DRC (Distribution Rate Class) types by segmenting customers based on energy consumption values, confirming that the algorithm-driven segments matched the company’s predefined DRC types. Applied Hierarchical Clustering with Ward’s linkage to further segment customers within each DRC type, identifying sub-segments revealing behaviors like peak consumption and time-of-use patterns.",
